I recently obtained my master's degree in software & data engineering with my thesis: Java Vector API: Benchmarking and Performance Analysis. During the thesis, I developed JVBench to test the performance and find patterns of the incubator Java Vector API.

I'm currently searching for my first job experience as a software & data engineer. Meanwhile, I continue to learn new topics of interest.
